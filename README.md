# StrongPassword

StrongPassword provides entropy-based password strength checking for your apps.

The idea stemmed from the
"[Checking Password Strength](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/549/the-definitive-guide-to-forms-based-website-authentication)"
section on StackOverflow.

It is an adaptation of a [PHP algorithm](http://cubicspot.blogspot.com/2011/11/how-to-calculate-password-strength.html)
developed by Thomas Hruska.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'strong_password'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install strong_password
